#### 1. Incorrect documentation for another repository

The contents that were once listed here were meant for the README.md for the Github repository aluan-report_temp_generator, not this README.md!

- [aluan-report_temp_generator README.md](https://github.com/aluan-fooshe/aluan-report_temp_generator/blob/main/README.md)
- [aluan-report_temp_generator repository](https://github.com/aluan-fooshe/aluan-report_temp_generator/)

#### 2. Diary-related .py files added, deleted permanently from original directory.
